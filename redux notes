import { PartyMode } from "@mui/icons-material"

there is only one dispatch function from "usedispatch()" hook
and for every actoin dispatched all the reducers are run

action{type:abc,payload:value}------>>>>> dispatched(fired)---->>MIDDLEWARE----->>root reducers--all the reducers
----->update state

that us whys in useEffect , adding of dispatch as dependency is not good

whenever any action fires and as long as the reducer updates,it does not matter which Part of
reducer u r listening to,every single component that has useSelector will re-run

middlewares sit in between cpmponents and reducers (after action dispatch) before reducer
